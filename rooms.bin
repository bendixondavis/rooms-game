[Intro]
You walk up to the old house at the end of the street.
The paint is chipped and falling off.
The gutters are hanging from the roof.
The shingles are curled and falling off.
Most of the windows are broken and filled in with cobwebs.
You decide to walk up to the door and knock.
The door slowly swings open.
You hear a low whispered voice say '{}, please come in'.
[Entry]
You walk through the door into an entryway.
There are tattered shreds of newspapers and clothes all over the floor.
There is a black umbrella lying in the corner next to a closet covered in cobwebs.
The is a closet is in front of you, a staircase is to your right,
and another door is on the left.
[Bedroom]
This room has a worn out, slumped bed.
Next to the bed is a dresser made of old worn wood with a cracked mirror.
[Closet]
There is nothing in the closet.  There is a crack in the lower portion of the wall
that goes down until it hits the floor.
[Kitchen]
This is a kitchen.
The stove is rusted and covered in old grease.
There are pots and pans laying all over the floor.
[Bathroom]
This is a bathroom.  The toilet bowl is filled with brown slime
and the bathtub is stained and chipped.
